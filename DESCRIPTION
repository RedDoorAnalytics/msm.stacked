Description: Create stacked probabilities plots for multi-state models fitted using
    the 'msm' package. Plots are created using the 'ggplot2' package, and can be
    further customised by the user. State transition probabilities over time can also
    be calculated, including conditional predictions on being in a certain state at 
    a given time.
